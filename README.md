Reduce: Minimize waste generation by using fewer resources and opting for products with less packaging.

Reuse: Find new uses for items instead of discarding them, such as repurposing materials or donating unused goods.

Recycle: Convert waste materials into new products to conserve resources and reduce pollution.

Recover: Extract useful energy or materials from waste that cannot be reduced, reused, or recycled, often through processes like incineration or anaerobic digestion. # WASTE-MANAGEMENT
